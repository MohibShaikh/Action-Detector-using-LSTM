### Action Detection with LSTMs
A Comprehensive Approach to Video Action Recognition

This repository implements a robust action detection system utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

#### Key Functionalities
- Granular Video Analysis: Analyzes videos frame-by-frame to identify and classify human actions.
- Leveraging Pre-trained CNNs: Employs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for efficient feature extraction, such as body joint positions.
- Temporal Sequence Learning: Utilizes LSTMs to capture the temporal relationships between extracted features, crucial for understanding the unfolding action in a video.
- Action Classification: Based on the learned sequence features, the model accurately predicts the action being performed in each video frame.
#### Advantages of LSTM Integration
- Superior Temporal Understanding: LSTMs excel at capturing temporal information, essential for recognizing actions that evolve overtime in videos.
- Synergy with Feature Extraction: The system leverages the power of pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction, providing a strong foundation for robust action recognition.
