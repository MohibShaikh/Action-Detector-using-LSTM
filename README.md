Action Detection with LSTMs! ‍♀️
Unleash the power of LSTMs for action recognition in videos!

This repository is your one-stop shop for building an action detection system using Long Short-Term Memory networks.

What it does:

️‍♀️ Scrutinizes videos frame-by-frame to identify what actions are unfolding.
Leverages pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract key features like body joint positions.
⏳ Utilizes LSTMs to understand the flow of these features over time, crucial for recognizing actions.
Predicts the action happening in each video frame with impressive accuracy.
Why LSTMs?

⏳ Masters of Time: LSTMs excel at capturing temporal information, essential for recognizing actions that evolve over time in videos.
Building on a Strong Foundation: By leveraging pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction, the system gains a powerful foundation for action recognition.
